# Messaging System Setup Instructions

## Overview
The messaging system is now fully implemented with the following features:
- Event-scoped messaging (users can only message attendees in the same event)
- Real-time message updates using Supabase subscriptions
- Thread-based conversations
- Unread message indicators
- Search functionality to find attendees
- Message retention (1 day after event ends)
- Responsive UI with proper styling

## Database Setup

### 1. Run the Enhanced Schema
Execute the SQL in `enhance-messaging-schema.sql` in your Supabase dashboard:

```sql
-- This adds:
-- - is_read and read_at columns to messages table
-- - message_threads table for better thread management
-- - Indexes for performance
-- - RLS policies for message_threads
-- - Helper functions for thread management
```

### 2. Verify RLS Policies
Make sure these policies are active in your Supabase dashboard:

**Messages table:**
- Users can view messages in their threads
- Users can send messages

**Message_threads table:**
- Users can view threads they participate in
- Users can create threads
- Users can update threads they participate in

    â””â”€â”€ profile/
        â””â”€â”€ user-profile.tsx         # Updated with message button
```

## Usage

### For Users
1. **Start a conversation**: Tap the message icon in the header or the message button on a profile
2. **Search attendees**: Use the search bar in the inbox to find people to message
3. **View conversations**: Tap on any thread in the inbox to open the conversation
4. **Send messages**: Type in the composer at the bottom and press Enter or tap Send

### For Developers
1. **Message Service**: Use `MessageService` from `@/lib/message-service-simple`
2. **Real-time Updates**: The service includes subscription methods for live updates
3. **Event Scoping**: All messages are automatically scoped to the current event
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces

## Styling
The messaging system uses your existing design system:
- Orange gradient buttons (`#EC874E` to `#BF341E`)
- Unread indicators in bright orange (`#EC874E`)
- Badge colors in red-orange (`#BF341E`)
- Consistent with your existing card and button styles

## Performance Considerations
- Messages are indexed by `thread_id` and `created_at` for fast queries
- Real-time subscriptions are optimized to only listen to relevant events
- Unread counts are calculated efficiently using database counts
- Thread lists are sorted by most recent activity

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Email notifications for offline users
- [ ] Message retention automation (delete messages 1 day after event ends)
- [ ] Typing indicators
- [ ] Message reactions
- [ ] File/image sharing
- [ ] Push notifications

## Testing
1. Create two user accounts
2. Join the same event with both accounts
3. Send messages between the accounts
4. Verify real-time updates work
5. Check unread indicators appear and disappear correctly
6. Test search functionality

## Troubleshooting
- **Messages not appearing**: Check RLS policies are correctly set
- **Real-time not working**: Verify Supabase real-time is enabled
- **Type errors**: Make sure database types are updated with message_threads table
- **Search not working**: Ensure event_members table has proper data

The messaging system is now ready for production use! ðŸŽ‰
